Use it as you wish, remembering that you are doing so at your own risk! The risk being losing your photos in the process.
Though I'm extra careful when it comes to managing my photos and so far was able to keep them all (I hope/think) there is always a remote possibility that something can go wrong.
So work on a copy of the files, then after some validation of the output remove the original.
