I'm no lawyer so here are my rules.

Rule One
Use it at your own risk! The risk being losing your photos in the process. 
Though I'm extra careful when it comes to managing my photos and so far was able to keep them all (I think) there is always a remote possibility that something can go wrong. 
So work on a copy of the files, then after some validation of the output remove the original.

Rule Two
If you somehow are able to make money out of this then probably I would like to get piece of it ;)
If it's for your own usage - knock your self out!
